      <p className="hero-intro">
      Software Engineer with over 2 years of hands-on experience designing and developing robust backend systems and full-stack web applications. My technical expertise lies in working with Java, Spring Boot, React, and Databases, and I specialize in building scalable, secure, and high-performance solutions that solve real-world business challenges.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>I have experience creating and maintaining RESTful and GraphQL APIs, implementing asynchronous processing using Spring Bootâ€™s @Async and CompletableFuture, and building clean, modular frontends with React and Redux Toolkit.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Currently, Iâ€™m contributing to the Illinois Department of Innovation & Technology, where Iâ€™m responsible for developing responsive user interfaces, optimizing database performance, and architecting transaction-heavy systems deployed on AWS services like Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. Iâ€™ve worked on integrating tools like Apache Kafka for event-driven communication and Elasticsearch for fast, full-text search capabilities.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and improving development efficiency through CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Docker. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, building personal projects like e-commerce platforms and dashboards, and engaging in coding challenges to stay sharp. Iâ€™m also focused on expanding my knowledge in distributed systems, cloud-native architecture, and system observability to continue growing as a backend and systems-focused engineer.</p>
